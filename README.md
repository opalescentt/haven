# Project Description - Haven
Deployed website: [here]

Haven is a platform concept designed to address communication gaps before, during, and after foster care placement, so caregivers are better prepared and equipped throughout the process. At the moment of placement, information is often limited, unclear, or delayed, making it difficult for caregivers to understand a child’s needs and what support will be required. These gaps exist largely because communication and information transfer depend on individual caseworker capacity rather than a consistent, centralized system.

Structural barriers further complicate the experience. Foster caregivers, biological parents, and kins lacks the bridge to freely share and access information from each other due to confidentiality issues. Important care resources such as education facilities, healthcare information, and cultural/religious habits are often scattered across agencies or arrive late, leaving caregivers to spend significant time chasing information and making high-stakes decisions with limited clarity.

Haven’s MVP is intentionally scoped to reduce these gaps by providing a single, secure platform for referrals, resources, and community engagement. Rather than replacing existing child welfare systems, the MVP focuses on improving access, awareness, and connection—helping caregivers understand what information is available, where to go for support, and how to navigate placement with greater confidence before, during, and after it occurs.
